I have completed the required courses of MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science, **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)**.

Previously, I have a period of research experience at [School of Engineering](https://engineering.westlake.edu.cn/), **Westlake University**.  

Feel free to [email](mailto:stevezhangz@163.com)  me if you have any suggestions.
